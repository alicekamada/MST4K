## Synopsis

MST4K is a simple server package that lets you host a virtual theater website with viewer chat.

## Motivation

As a Hack Reactor Remote student, we didn't really have any way to do the standard social nights that onsite students have. This is an attempt to facilitate that, with movie nights.

## Installation

Inside the config folder, there will eventually be a sample file to config the Vid-Streamer middleware. For now, the configuration info can be found [here][1].

## Tests

Coming soon.

## Contributors

This project will use the git flow model, but it is currently unenforced. Until then, only approved contributors will have their pull requests considered.
